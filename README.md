# Computational Electromagnetics (FDTD Analysis)

Python codes for implementing the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method to solve the Maxwell's equations for modelling different electromagnetic structures.

A brief description of the codes -

1) ***homog_gau.py***  -  Gaussian pulse propagation in a homogeneous medium

2) ***homog_gau_abc.py***  -  Gaussian pulse propagation in a homogeneous medium terminated with Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC)

3) ***interface_gau.py***  -  Gaussian Pulse propagation through an interface with ABC at left & right boundaries

4) ***interface_sin.py***  -  Sine wave propagation through an interface with ABC at left & right boundaries

5) ***Microstrip_SW.py***  -  50 Ohm Microstrip transmission line with an open termination (ZL = inf) and ABC at left & right boundaries

6) ***Microstrip_SW 2.py***  -  Two symmetrically spaced 50 Ohm Microstrip transmission lines with open termination (ZL = inf) and ABC at left & right boundaries

7) ***Microstrip_SW 2 dielectric.py***  -  Two symmetrically spaced 50 Ohm Microstrip transmission lines with open termination (ZL = inf), a cylindrical dielectric region in between the 2 striplines and feed on one strip
